EventSource is a Swift package that provides a simple implementation of a client for [Server-Sent Events](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html) (SSE). It allows you to easily receive real-time updates from a server over a persistent HTTP connection, using a simple and efficient interface.

It also leverages Swift concurrency features to provide a more expressive and intuitive way to handle asynchronous operations.

> [!Note]
> Please note that this package was originally developed to be used in conjunction with another package, and as such, it may not cover all specification details. Please be aware of this limitation when evaluating whether EventSource is suitable for your specific use case.

## Features

- [x] Simple Swift API for SSE
- [x] Supports data-only mode
- [x] Data race safety with Swift 6

## Installation

The module name of the package is `EventSource`. Choose one of the instructions below to install and add the following import statement to your source code.

```swift
import EventSource
```

#### [Xcode Package Dependency](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app)

From Xcode menu: `File` > `Swift Packages` > `Add Package Dependency`

```text
https://github.com/Recouse/EventSource
```

#### [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/)

In your `Package.swift` file, first add the following to the package `dependencies`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Recouse/EventSource.git"),
```

And then, include "EventSource" as a dependency for your target:

```swift
.target(name: "<target>", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "EventSource", package: "EventSource"),
]),
```

## Usage

Using EventSource is easy. Simply create a new data task from an instance of EventSource with the URLRequest of the SSE endpoint you want to connect to, and await for events:
```swift
import EventSource

Task {
    let eventSource = EventSource()
    let dataTask = eventSource.dataTask(for: urlRequest)
    
    for await event in dataTask.events() {
        switch event {
        case .open:
            print("Connection was opened.")
        case .error(let error):
            print("Received an error:", error.localizedDescription)
        case .event(let event):
            print("Received an event", event.data ?? "")
        case .closed:
            print("Connection was closed.")
        }
    }
}
```

Use `dataTask.cancel()` to explicitly close the connection. However, in that case `.closed` event won't be emitted.

### Data-only mode

EventSource can be used in data-only mode, making it suitable for popular APIs like [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview). Below is an example using OpenAI's [completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation) API:
```swift
Task {
    var urlRequest = URLRequest(url: URL(string: "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions")!)
    urlRequest.allHTTPHeaderFields = [
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer \(accessToken)"
    ]
    urlRequest.httpMethod = "POST"
    urlRequest.httpBody = """
    {
        "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
        "messages": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Why is the sky blue?"}
        ],
        "stream": true
    }
    """.data(using: .utf8)!
    
    let eventSource = EventSource(mode: .dataOnly)
    let dataTask = eventSource.dataTask(for: urlRequest)
    
    var response: String = ""
    
    for await event in dataTask.events() {
        switch event {
        case .event(let event):
            if let data = eventDevent.data?.data(using: .utf8) {
                let chunk = try? JSONDecoder().decode(ChatCompletionChunk.self, from: data)
                let string = chunk?.choices.first?.delta.content ?? ""
                response += string
            }
        default:
            break
        }
    }
    
    print(response)
}
```
